In 2018, using Java I developed a desktop application for designing solar parks, helping the work of engineers at the company. With the application an entire solar park could be built to scale. It also calculated the amount of materials required for the construction which was compiled in a PDF. In the same year, I started to familiarize myself with a Drupal page.

                    It was written in PHP and Javascript, provided with a MySQL database connection. Since I didn’t have a competent developer by my side at the time, I had to learn the languages and the system itself on my own. At first, I did minor bug fixed and maintenance work, but later I was given larger tasks, and finally I developed entire subpages and my first API, with which a mobile application communicates, as well.</p>

There were 6 levels and you had to eliminate different opponents. After it was completed, I made it available for download in the Unity Assets Store for a while and I also earned some money with it. As a young university student I was really proud of that feat. The most important lesson was how time-consuming a project of such a caliber is for a sole developer, and that you always have to give an estimate for the work.

                        <p class="floating-text fadeInit fadeInRight">Thanks to my experience in Unity3D, I received a job offer through the University which I had accepted with pleasure. My task was to further develop the welding simulator named DL-Weld Trainer, aslo in C#. The device consisted of hardware and software, and was intended to train and evaluate welding apprentices. The position of markers placed on the workpiece and dummy welding torch was recorded by a high-speed camera mounted on the helmet and placed in the virtual space.
                        It was an exciting chellenge – work took place between 2014 and 2015. The job required regular consultation and I used a version control system Subversion (SVN) for the first time.
